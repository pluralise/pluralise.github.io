## Some recent research, translated!:

- [Establishing the gut microbiota after birth (AKA there are bugs in your belly)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-019-0276-4): Following birth, microorganisms rapidly populate the newborn baby's gut; the way you are delivered from your mother shapes the bugs in your belly! Studies of DNA of bugs growing in baby poo (these bugs were "born" in the baby's gut) showed that babies delivered vaginally were enriched with commensals (see below), whereas those delivered by caesarean section were depleted of commensal species and dominated by opportunistic pathogens (diseases!) associated with the hospital environment (including Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Klebsiella species). 
	*commensalism: an association between two organisms in which one benefits and the other derives neither benefit nor harm.*

- [Yeasts and how they came to be](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-019-0274-6.pdf): insights  generated by the [Y1000+ project which sequences yeasts](https://y1000plus.wei.wisc.edu/) reveal that bacteria sometimes share DNA with yeasts! Sharing is caring.

- [this one:Gene expression is encoded in all parts of a co-evolving interacting gene regulatory structure](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/792531v1) (TBD)
