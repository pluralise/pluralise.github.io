## South-West Agroecology Network Funding Application

- A recent application for [this Brigstow Seedcorn Funding](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/brigstow/funding/seedcorn-funding)

***What is the research project? What are the initial research questions that you want to explore? How will you go about answering them? Why do they matter? How does your project help understand how we live well in the 21st Century? Max 500 words***

*Nature is a network of living systems nesting within other living systems that are interconnected [1]*

Our recent Brigstow ideas exchange (20/01/21 workshop) involving 20 agroecology researchers & practitioners in South-West UK highlighted participant’s energy and intent to interconnect. We are applying for funding to enable interconnection through co-produced research into the following questions identified.

**ECOLOGICAL LITERACY: How does ecological literacy affect the ability of humans to comprehend and interact with current crises?**
Once rooted in ecologies, our food systems have been replaced by exploitative agricultural practices.  Practitioners highlighted that increasing ecological literacy in publics could reconfigure normative expectations and behaviours to value agroecology. Ecological literacy considers how to embed our lives, habits, processes and language within ecological systems. Participatory research methodologies including Landscape and Body mapping- understanding focal points where people connect to their local environment and Photovoice- a photographic diary process allowing people to tell a narrative documenting lived experiences will be used to prepare our relationships and understanding to meet the scale and complexity of our climate-ecological crises. 

**ACCESS TO LAND: How does access to land affect the uptake of agroecology in the south west? What is preventing this access and how could this be overcome?**
Our farming populations lack diversity in age, gender, and race and this creates socially, politically and environmentally unsustainable farming systems. We will engage landowners, prospective farmers and organisations focussing on land rights to explore what is preventing access to land and how this is affecting the uptake of agroecology in the south west.

**BELIEFS AND BEHAVIOURS: What are the deep set beliefs and behaviours of farmers and academics preventing our food system from making an agroecological transition?** 
We aim to investigate forms of thinking preventing our regional food system from transition to agroecology. 

**COLLABORATION: What is the role of collaborative processes in supporting and promoting agroecological systems?**
Regionally, agroecological activities are supported by farmer-farmer networks. These networks share agroecological ideas too, as do academic networks. We would use participatory mapping and group reflection through play to explore the role of collaboration in transitioning to agroecology in the south-west. 

In this moment of climate, social, economic and cultural transition, agroecology’s vision of humans as a key part of landscapes and ecologies offers meaning and direction to live well by. 
These research questions address gaps slowing down the transition to environmentally, socially, economically and politically just food systems through which residents can live well in relationship with land. Addressing these questions through critical making enables the network to become-with one another [2].

***Who is involved? What knowledge and expertise do the different members of your interdisciplinary and/or co-produced team bring? Why do you want to work together? Max 500 words***

Broadly, network members include academics, agroecology practitioners and non-academic experts (see list at bottom). As a network, we want to work together in order to learn from and grow connections. We all seek to reach towards a common goal: increasing the uptake and ease of agroecology in South-West UK through co-created research.

Network members would lead the network on particular research questions, all are early-career.

The network decided that sociocracy should be utilised as a means of organising. We would arrange 2 training sessions for members. This will allow development of a decentralised organisational structure whereby network members associate into smaller working groups which are able to make decisions swiftly with a minimum of time used for bureaucracy. 

***What will you be making together? This is an opportunity to think creatively. Toolkits, artefacts, texts, performances exhibitions objects, blog posts, working papers, interventions, applications for further funding are all acceptable outputs for the research project but we strongly encourage all teams to make something and document the process! Max 500 words***

Funding would enable a research lead to guide the network in investigating each research question through critical making.

**ECOLOGICAL LITERACY**
Using the aforementioned methodologies, the research process will co-create visual, mixed media outputs, this may be in the form of an Ecological Literacy toolkit, or a series of podcasts. We endeavour to co-produce with participants and the network, exploring the most appropriate mechanism for improving and learning ecological literacy.

**ACCESS TO LAND**
Lack of diversity in our farming systems is a problem with its roots in a complex mixture of issues. It is far too easy to blame rich landowners for being greedy rather than take a systems view of this issue. Though bringing together multiple stakeholders in this issue (land owners and prospective farmers) we will create a fictional audio dialogue. This will be a discussion between a land owner assessing the risk of making a small parcel of land available to a new entrant and a prospective farmer assessing the risks involved in starting a small rural business in modern Britain. Through this we will unpeel the complex nature of perceived and real barriers that prevent access to land in the south west today.

**BELIEFS AND BEHAVIOURS**
This investigation will combine original historicist research, structured interviews with members of the network, and workshops at collaborative events. This work will identify pervasive forms of thinking across farming and academia, examining deep set beliefs and behaviours as they recur, and perhaps differ in important ways, across agriculture and the academy. 

**COLLABORATION**
We will  facilitate network members to map within and beyond the network collaboratively in real time. Through connecting them, shared struggles, support and synergies can arise. The process of co-producing a map would take place in three parts. (1) online facilitation of live network mapping. (2) map augmentation using online research and crowd-sourced input. Creative outputs will include a database of research, resources, stake-holders and funding. (3) Network gathering facilitated by a participatory creative agroecological enterprise (Play Wooden CIC) commissioned to deliver a game (run via Zoom) designed to encourage collaboration and using elements from the map. Followed by a reflection on how connections can enable farmers to transition towards agroecological practices and what the role of collaborative processes in supporting and promoting agroecological systems. 

In taking a critical making approach to questions arising from research gaps the network identified, the network will entangle. In this process, an assemblage will grow through which the wealth of agroecology knowledge and resources can be shared in revolutionary ways. Thus facilitating the transition to agroecological food systems and enabling understandings and realities of living well in South-West UK.  For each research question, a blog post will be made by the research lead, with a working paper being a stretch objective. All resources created will be shared online under a creative commons free cultural works licence for the growing agroecology community in the south west.
