PhD researcher based in the [Biocompute Lab](https://biocomputelab.github.io/) at the University of Bristol

### More about me:
- [Linked-in (including up to date CV)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-tarnowski/)
- [Talks](https://biocomputelab.github.io/team/matt-tarnowski/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/synbioscientist)

### Interests:
\- microbiology - soil - [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing) - fermenting - permaculture - responsible innovation - music - making the university useful for all -

### Current Projects:

#### Microbiology
- Studying ["junk" DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_DNA) using DNA sequencing (hint - it's not junk!)
- [Studying microorganisms in soil around Bristol using DNA sequencing and studying the results](https://bristolbiodesign.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2019/02/25/become-a-biological-engineer-kicks-off-in-bristol/)

#### Permaculture
- Growing vegetables at the allotment and with the [Matthew Tree Project](https://the-matthew-tree-project.org/) at [Hartcliffe Community Farm](https://www.facebook.com/Hartcliffefarm/)

#### At the interface of microbiology and permaculture
- [Thinking about sustainable futures and responsible research](https://soundcloud.com/university-of-bristol/bristols-one-city-plan-an-interdisciplinary-dialogue-on-a-sustainable-future-city?in=university-of-bristol/sets/research-without-borders-2019)
- A [blog](https://pluralise.github.io/) to translate research and make it more accessible
- A growing interest in the use of microorganisms to produce things we eat and drink: fermenting cider and beer / mushroom cultivation / use of [biofertilisers](http://www.ragmans.co.uk/learn_with_us/our_approach_at_ragmans/make_your_own_biofertiliser/) / composting / [wetland ecosystems](http://www.biologicdesign.co.uk/page.php?pageid=home) etc
